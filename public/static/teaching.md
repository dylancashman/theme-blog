# Teaching

I love to teach.  I think that teaching someone a new concept is one of the most rewarding things there are in life.  It's also one of the best ways to develop a mastery in a subject: if someone puts their trust in you and takes your class, you have to be prepared for any question, which means you should anticipate any question that could be asked.  It's also great practice for professional and scientific communication.

### Experience

I worked as an academic tutor for students aged 10-18 for abouta decade, through high school, college, and during my Master's program.  Besides that, I have had the opportunity to work as a TA or guest lecturer in several courses in Computer Science and Mathematics.

- I am a guest lecturer for **COMP 150VA - Visual Analytics** at Tufts University in the Fall of 2019 for two classes (*Visual Analytics for Machine Learning* and *Machine Learning For Visual Analytics*), as well as their respective labs.
- I was a head TA for the infamous **COMP 40 - Machine Structure and Assembly Language** at Tufts University in Spring of 2017.  Before that, I was a graduate TA for the same course in the Fall of 2016.
- I was a graduate TA for **COMP 61 - Discrete Math** at Tufts University in Fall of 2015.
- During undergrad, I was TA one semester for **MATH 19 - Calculus II** and two semesters for **MATH 20 - Multivariable Calculus**.  I was also a grader for **MATH 52 - Linear Algebra**.

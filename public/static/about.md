# About Me

I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Tufts University.  I work under Dr. Remco Chang in the [Visual Analytics Lab at Tufts (VALT)](https://valt.cs.tufts.edu).

I received my Masters of Science in Computer Science at Tufts University in 2016, and my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Brown University in 2010.

In the winter of 2017, I passed my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelims#United_States_graduate_programs">Qualification Exams</a>, taking tests in Visualization, Human Computer Interaction, and Statistical Pattern Recognition.

Before grad school, I built Ruby on Rails systems for healthcare nonprofits in the Boston area at Annkissam.  During my graduate study, I have interned at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Palo Alto Research Center, and the MIT IBM Watson AI Lab.
